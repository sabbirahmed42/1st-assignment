            <p>Today’s web development landscape is full of innovative projects and intelligent people. Together, these
                factors push the industry forward at amazing speeds, while also making it more difficult for individual
                web developers to be outstanding. As a solution to this problem, web developers create portfolios that
                will make them stand out.</p>

                <h2>mission</h2>
                <p>As a new developer, one of the hardest tasks is to create a successful web developer portfolio that
                    gets
                    the attention of potential employers, especially when the job market is overcrowded, and tensions
                    run
                    high.</p>

                <h2>vission</h2>
                <p>Having a good web developer portfolio not only showcases your creativity and efficiency but also
                    highlights your level of expertise and professionalism.</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>Some developers find web-based portfolios to be redundant, mostly because today there are a number of
                    quicker, easier ways to share your work and gain the desired recognition. You could use Twitter,
                    Dribbble, dev.to, and GitHub to name a few of the more useful.</p>

            <p class="high-para">To achieve this, you need to implement various features, run tests, and take time to
                ensure that the site
                is optimized for use. During this process, you gain valuable hands-on experience and problem-solving
                practice.

            <p class="high-para">Building your profile from the ground up is indeed somewhat more difficult than using a
                template or
                enlisting the help of a web designer. However, doing so will ensure that you can customize how your
                site’s browsing experience will look to your users.</p>
